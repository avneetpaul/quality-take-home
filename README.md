# Quality Engineer / SDET Offline Questions and Exercise

Greetings, and welcome to the Splice Quality Engineer Offline Questions and Exercise! The purpose of this repo is to house questions and "take home" exercise, central to our hiring process for this role. 

Details and instructions about each of the activities may be found in each directory's `README.md` files.

There's a number of different ways we can review your submission - feel free to choose the one most comfortable for you:

- Email the hiring manager your implementation as a zip or link to your repo fork;
- Fork this repo and send a PR (community reviewed)
- Create an issue with the url for your implementation (community reviewed)

We are grading the exercise based on a number of factors, which include the robustness of the created test set, organization of work, your communication style. Relax, have fun, and thank you for your time and attention for these activities!


Best,
Brenna, Mike, Kath, Carol, and Rolando
